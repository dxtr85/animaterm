# Read glyph definitions from file
# Glyph index file is a simple text file. 
# Each line is a path to actual file with glyph definitions
# Actual file with glyph definitions have following format:
# 65+5,77,78
# Above line defines seven glyphs 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 77, 78.
# Values are decimal representations of Unicode characters.
# In each file only first 10 non-comment lines are read, 
# with up to 16 glyphs from each line.
#
# glyphs path-to-glyphs-index-file

# You can also define your own key bindings for user interface.
# Key definitions in this file should match Key enum in key.rs file.
# In general they follow this format:
# [Alt][Ctrl][Shift]<some capital letter or symbol>
# There are some exceptions like Enter (CtrlJ does not exist), 
# Backspace (CtrlH does not exist either) etc.
